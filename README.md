# 📩 Spam Classification Using CNN

## 🧭 Overview
This project focuses on detecting **spam messages in Email data** using **Deep Learning**.  
The goal is to automatically classify messages as *spam* or *ham* (non-spam) based on their textual content.

After experimenting with traditional preprocessing and tokenization methods, I applied a **1D Convolutional Neural Network (Conv1D CNN)** to learn meaningful patterns in the text data.  
The model successfully captures contextual word relationships and achieves **high accuracy in spam detection**.

## ⚙️ How It Works

### 🧹 1. Data Preprocessing
- Unnecessary columns were dropped, and labels were mapped to:
  - `0` → ham (non-spam)
  - `1` → spam  
- **Text cleaning**:
  - Tokenization with **NLTK**
  - Removal of English **stopwords**
  - Conversion of text into numeric **sequences** using Keras `Tokenizer`
  - Padding sequences to equal lengths with `pad_sequences`

### ⚖️ 2. Handling Class Imbalance
- The dataset was imbalanced (more *ham* than *spam* messages).
- Used **SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique)** to generate synthetic spam samples, balancing the dataset before training.

### 🧠 3. CNN Model Architecture
The model is built using **Keras Sequential API**:
1. **Embedding Layer** – converts word indices into dense vector representations.  
2. **Conv1D Layers** – slide multiple filters (kernels) across sequences to extract n-gram features and local patterns.  
3. **MaxPooling & GlobalMaxPooling** – reduce dimensionality and focus on the most important features.  
4. **Batch Normalization** – stabilizes learning and accelerates convergence.  
5. **Dropout** – prevents overfitting by randomly dropping neurons during training.  
6. **Dense Layers** – learn higher-level representations.  
7. **Sigmoid Output Layer** – outputs probability between 0 (ham) and 1 (spam).

The **ReLU activation function** was used throughout hidden layers for efficiency and non-linearity.  
The **Adam optimizer** combined the benefits of momentum and adaptive learning rate to speed up convergence.
